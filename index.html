    <h2>Background</h2>
    <div class="underline"></div>
    <div class="background-text">

        <p>
          The background of cryptocurrency traces back to the late 20th
          century when cryptography and digital currencies were conceptualized
          as alternatives to traditional centralized financial systems.
          However, it wasn't until 2008, with the publication of a whitepaper
          titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" by an
          anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto, that the modern era of
          cryptocurrency began.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency, introduced the
          groundbreaking concept of blockchain technology. This distributed
          ledger system enables secure and transparent peer-to-peer
          transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          The success of Bitcoin spurred the development of numerous
          alternative cryptocurrencies, collectively referred to as altcoins,
          each with its own unique features and use cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks, typically based
          on blockchain technology, which ensures immutability and
          transparency of transactions. The decentralized nature of
          cryptocurrencies offers several advantages, including censorship
          resistance, financial inclusion for the unbanked, and lower
          transaction fees compared to traditional banking systems. Despite
          its revolutionary potential, cryptocurrency adoption has faced
          challenges, including regulatory scrutiny, scalability issues, and
          concerns about security and privacy.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies continue to gain mainstream
          acceptance, with growing interest from institutional investors and
          established financial institutions. Beyond financial transactions,
          blockchain technology has found applications in various sectors,
          including supply chain management, healthcare, and voting systems,
          promising increased efficiency, transparency, and security.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, the background of cryptocurrency encompasses the
          evolution of decentralized digital currencies, pioneered by Bitcoin
          and propelled by advancements in blockchain technology. While facing
          hurdles, cryptocurrencies have the potential to revolutionize
          financial systems and reshape various industries in the digital age.

    <h2>The Future of Crypto</h2>
    <div class="underline"></div>
    <div class="background-text">
      <div>
        <p>The prediction of cryptocurrency usage in the future suggests a trajectory towards increased adoption and
          integration into mainstream financial systems and everyday transactions.</p>
        <p>Proponents envision a world where cryptocurrencies serve as a viable alternative to traditional fiat
          currencies, offering greater financial inclusivity, efficiency, and security.</p>
        <p>One key prediction is the continued growth of cryptocurrency as a store of value and medium of exchange. With
          ongoing technological advancements and improvements in scalability and transaction speeds, cryptocurrencies
          are expected to become more accessible and user-friendly, facilitating widespread adoption among consumers and
          businesses alike.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the integration of cryptocurrencies into existing financial infrastructure, such as payment
          networks and banking systems, is anticipated to streamline cross-border transactions, reduce transaction
          costs, and enhance financial transparency and security.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Another prediction is the emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, which leverage blockchain
          technology to offer innovative financial services such as lending, borrowing, and trading without the need for
          traditional intermediaries.</p>
        <p>DeFi has the potential to democratize access to financial services globally, empowering individuals to
          participate in the global economy regardless of their geographic location or socioeconomic status.
          Additionally, as regulatory frameworks around the world continue to evolve and mature, cryptocurrencies are
          expected to gain greater legitimacy and acceptance from governments and regulatory bodies.</p>
        <p>This increased regulatory clarity is likely to attract institutional investors and large corporations,
          further fueling the growth of the cryptocurrency market. Overall, the prediction for the future of
          cryptocurrency usage is optimistic, envisioning a transformative shift towards a more decentralized,
          transparent, and inclusive financial system.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>ETFs are like baskets that hold lots of different investments, such as stocks, bonds, or cryptocurrencies. By
          buying just one share of an ETF, you instantly own a little bit of everything inside that basket.</p>
        <p>This helps spread out your risk and makes investing easier and more affordable. For crypto, ETFs provide a
          way to invest in a variety of cryptocurrencies without needing to buy each one individually. In late 2023 to
          2024 there were many etf's of bitcoin getting approved by SEC(Securities and Exchange Commission).</p>
        <p>It's a government agency in the United States responsible for regulating and overseeing the securities
          industry, including stock exchanges, brokerage firms, and investment advisers. The SEC's main goal is to
          protect investors, maintain fair and orderly markets, and facilitate capital formation. By them approving etf
          will bring more investors to the cryptocurrencie world and gives it institutional adoption.</p>
